=============

A 320 and Up / Semantic Grid System, responsive WordPress starter theme.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**This is a responsive, HTML5, starter theme for WordPress, based on [320andup](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/) and [semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/).**

**View Demo: [320andup.mattbailey.co](http://320andup.mattbailey.co/)**

This is a vanilla WordPress theme using 320 An Up as a starter point. It includes basic support for a Custom Menu, Post Thumbnails and a Sidebar. I've also included The Semantic Grid System for a fluid, responsive layout.

I put it together as a starting point for my some of my own projects and I thought others might find it useful too.
